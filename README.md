Alright so basically *workerinstall* is basically unmaintainable code since it is a mess. I'm going to rewrite it so here you have *worker*.
In worker.c it'll be compiled in bin/worker, once worker is finished I think I can either rename worker to workerinstall or just make a symlink to workerinstall.

But yeah development is happening in worker.c, workerinstall.c is just a mess.

tree.c is from https://www.programiz.com/dsa/binary-tree
